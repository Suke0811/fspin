# **fspin**
A small utility for running Python functions or coroutines at a fixed rate. It offers ROS-like rate control with optional performance reporting.

## Features
- `loop()` context manager for scoped background loops
- `@spin` decorator to easily loop sync or async functions
- `rate` / `RateControl` class for manual control
- Adjustable frequency at runtime
- Optional detailed performance reports
- Auto-detection of coroutines (no need to specify `is_async=True`)
- Support for both blocking and fire-and-forget patterns for async functions

## Usage
```python
import time
from fspin import spin


@spin(freq=1000, report=True)
def function_to_loop():
  # things to loop
  time.sleep(0.0005) # a fake task to take 0.5ms


# call the function
function_to_loop() # this will be blocking, and start looping
# it'll automatically catch the keyboard interrupt
# we have async version too
```

### with Context-Manager
```python
import time
from fspin import loop

def heartbeat():
    print(f"Heartbeat at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}")

# Runs in background thread at 2Hz, auto-stops on exit, prints report
with loop(heartbeat, freq=2, report=True, thread=True):
    time.sleep(5)  # keep the block alive for 5s
    print("exiting the loop")
# automatically exit the loop after 5 sec
print("Loop exited")
```

### Using Rate Class directly
```python
import time
from fspin import rate

# Create a rate control for a simple function
rc = rate(freq=10, is_coroutine=False, report=True, thread=True)

# Start spinning your function in background
rc.start_spinning(lambda: print("Tick"), None)

# Let it run 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)

# Stop the loop and print report
rc.stop_spinning()
```


### Async with Fire-and-Forget Pattern
```python
import asyncio
from fspin import spin, loop

# Using the @spin decorator with wait=False for fire-and-forget
@spin(freq=10, report=True, wait=False)
async def background_task():
    print("Running in the background")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

async def main():
    # This returns immediately without waiting for all iterations
    rc = await background_task()
    print("Continuing with other work while task runs in background")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Do other work
    rc.stop_spinning()  # Stop the background task when done

# Using the loop context manager with wait=False
async def another_task():
    print("Another background task")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

async def another_main():
    async with loop(another_task, freq=10, report=True) as lp:
        print("Context manager returned immediately")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Do other work
    # Task is stopped when exiting the context
```

## Performance & Accuracy

The RateControl library is designed to maintain a desired loop frequency by compensating for deviations. Here's a summary of observed performance:

- **Synchronous Mode:**  
  - Any loop frequency (10-10000 Hz) should be able to achieve high average loop precision (99.98-100%).
  - On both Windows and Linux, synchronous loops using `time.sleep()` can achieve high accuracy. For example, a loop
    targeting 1000 Hz reached an average of ~999.81 Hz with minimal deviations. 

- **Asynchronous Mode:**  
  - Using `asyncio.sleep()`, asynchronous loops are more affected by OS-level timer resolutions.  
  - **Windows:** Often limited by a timer granularity of around 15 ms, so a loop set to 500 Hz may only reach ~65 Hz. The library will automatically warn you if you set a frequency higher than 65 Hz on Windows in async mode.
  - **Linux/macOS:** Generally provides finer sleep resolution, allowing asynchronous loops to run closer to the target frequency. Linux can achieve ~925 Hz and macOS up to ~4000 Hz in async mode.

- **Python Version Differences:**  
  - On **Windows** newer Python versions like 3.12 will have better accuracy due to different implementation of time.sleep
